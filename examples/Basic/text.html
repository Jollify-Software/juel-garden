                        The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System.
                        It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma.
                        It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
                        Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometres (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth
