# Juel Garden

A library of custom components written with [Lit](https://lit.dev/) to create 3D and VR scenes with [BabylonJS](https://www.babylonjs.com/).  
This library has been inspired by [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), but instead of [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) we are using Babylon.

## What's in the name

The name 'Garden' was chosen because of the [Hanging Gardens of Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Gardens_of_Babylon), we are using BabylonJS so this seems fitting.  
I am also inspired by [The Village Green Preservation Society](https://youtu.be/lc7dmu4G8oc), the main tutorial [builds a village](https://doc.babylonjs.com/start/chap2) and everytime I look at this tutorial I think about the village green and all the simple people.  
God save the village green!

# Development

I have developed this library by following the tutorials and taking some examples from the [Babylon Playground](https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/) and creating custom elements based on them.
